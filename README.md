## ToDoApp

A simple ToDoApp built with Vue.js

## Features

- Add, delete, archive tasks
- Statistics of tasks
- Gamification (Points & Badges)
- Color theme
- Local storaging
- Routing

## Disclaimer

This is my first Vue.js school project (SIT120), so don't give any high expectation.
<br>
Color theme works only on one page. If you ask why, I'm lazy :D

## Result

High Distinction
