## ToDoApp
A simple responsive [ToDoApp](https://inxtwilliqm.github.io/ToDoApp/#/) built with Vue.js

## Features
- Add, delete, archive tasks
- Statistics of tasks
- Gamification (Points & Badges)
- Color theme
- Local storaging
- Routing

## Grade
High Distinction
> [!NOTE]
This is my first Vue.js university project (SIT120), so don't give any high expectation. Color theme works only in one page due to time limitations.

## Bugs
Report on [Github](https://github.com/iNxtWilliqm/ToDoApp/issues/new) if you find any bugs.
